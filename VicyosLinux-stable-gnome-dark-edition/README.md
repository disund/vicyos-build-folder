VicyosLinux-Gnome-Dark-Edition **Q&A** :

**Why Gnome?**

To be honest, the Gnome Desktop Environment was never in my plans. I was satisfied with XFCE and Herbstluftwm. 
I never liked the "Vanilla Look" (the pure look or the original Gnome look). Not to mention the bad experiences
that I had with other distros with Gnome. But 2 weeks ago, I decided to give it "One Last Shot". So I installed ArcolinuxB with Gnome for the first time. <br />

After installing the Distro, I noticed that "something was different this time". Maybe because I was very
used to ArcolinuxB Distros. (We install it and it comes 99% ready to go), no headaches and so...
Then I started to play around with it, I did all I need to do and after 1 week using it with no headaches, no problems,
I was very satisfied with the experience. <br />

So, I told my bruh that I was thinking to make an ArcolinuxB Spinoff out off it. So, I put all together and started to
create my first ArcolinuxB Gnome Spinoff. Today I'm totally satisfied with this end result. <br />

**Why macOS esque?**

That's simple. I love it! I love its looking, style, and aesthetics.:two_hearts:  And I never could afford an iMac. :cry: :satisfied::satisfied::satisfied: <br />
