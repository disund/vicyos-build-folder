Another day, I was wondering how to enable, disable, or move the System-Tray from one side to the other on the Polybar, 
with no need to access the Polybar config folder, all the time it was needed.

So, I decided to write some "commands" or (Alias) to make it easy to enable, disable, or even move the System-Tray from the right to the left side of the Polybar,
just by using some easy commands on the terminal:



-------------------------------------------------------------------
How to enable the System-Tray on the right side of the Polybar:

Open a new terminal and type:

tray-right

then, hit ENTER!
There you go!


-------------------------------------------------------------------
How to enable the System-Tray on the left side of the Polybar:

tray-left

then, hit ENTER!
Sounds good, right?


-------------------------------------------------------------------
How to DISABLE the System-Tray from the Polybar:

tray-off

then, hit ENTER!
It's pretty easy, isn't it?
